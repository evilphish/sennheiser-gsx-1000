# Configuration file for the Sennheiser GSX 1000			#
# by Alexander Heuer <evilphish@phishtank.de>				#
#########################################################################
# With this device, regarding sinks,					#
# hw:1,0 is the mono "chat" output useful for mumble or similar voice	#
#        programs. Its offset from the main volume can be controlled	#
#	 with an extra volume knob on the side of the device.		#
# hw:1,1 is the main 7.1 channel surround output into the device and	#
# 	 is controlled directly via the main volume knob. 	 	#
#	    	       		    	     	    			#
# Regarding sources, hw:1,0 is the microphone input.			#
# 	    	     	       	   	      				#
# This configuration enables two output devices labeled "main output"	#
# and "chat output" with respect to the two previously mentioned sinks.	#
#     	    	    	 	    	    	       		 	#
# If you have troubles with your distributions volume control, use the	#
# pulseaudio pavucontrol program 	       	      	       	   	#
